The following CSS rule might lead to unexpected behavior due to the specificity of selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `div p` selector is more specific than `p`, so the `color: blue` rule will override `color: red` when applied to paragraph elements within a div. This might be unexpected if the intent was for all paragraph elements to be red.
