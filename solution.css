To fix this issue, ensure your CSS rules are ordered logically and you understand how selector specificity works. Here's a solution:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
div p {
  color: blue; /* Use only if a different color inside a div is needed*/
}
```

Alternatively, if you always want paragraphs to be red, regardless of parent elements, then remove the `div p` rule.
